# Achievement Targets

A local, Python-based application using the [Steamworks Web API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi) to collect and display a user's stats on their in-game achievements.

**Note**: You MUST have your Steam profile and library set to public for this to work. That is a limitation of the Steamworks Web API, not a personal choice.
